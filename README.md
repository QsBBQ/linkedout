# Mini CMS

You already know what a [Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) is. In this project we're going to build our own (very small) Content Management System. The content to be managed? Your own résumé.

### Code Reviews and Feedback

Remember, the absolute, tip-top, #1 priority is asking for and receiving feedback on your code. It's better to "fall short" of an iteration and ask for feedback on an incomplete version than it is to get stuck. It's better to ask for feedback on a hacked-together-but-working version than worry about whether it's "polished enough."

Indeed, even if you know your code is unpolished or incomplete, you may as well ask for feedback so that we can be working on that feedback in parallel while you're polishing or completing your code. The worst that could possibly happen is that we give you feedback you are already aware of.
